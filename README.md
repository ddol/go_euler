# My Project Euler solvers (in Go)

These are the go scripts I've written to solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. Each problem has it's own script file (scripts/problem000). 

You can see my progress on [my profile](https://projecteuler.net/progress=ddol):

### Running a Script

To run a specific problem script, navigate to the corresponding directory and execute the `main.go` file. For example, to run Problem 001:

```bash
cd scripts/problem001
go run main.go
```

### Dependencies

This project uses Go modules for dependency management. You can install the required dependencies by running:

```bash
go mod tidy
```
